## CI/CD Pipeline 

This project demonstrates the complete Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline implemented in an AWS environment using EC2 instances within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). It leverages a stack of DevOps tools including Jenkins, Maven, Ansible, Docker, and Kubernetes (EKS) to automate the building, testing, and deployment processes, enabling seamless and efficient delivery of web applications


```bash
  git clone https://github.com/ThanikaiCloudevops/web_app.git
```
## Steps 

This project utilizes Amazon Web Services (AWS) to host a multi-server infrastructure: one EC2 instance hosts Jenkins and Maven for continuous integration, another EC2 instance manages Ansible and Docker for infrastructure provisioning and containerization, while a separate EC2 instance serves as the control plane for an Amazon EKS Kubernetes cluster.
